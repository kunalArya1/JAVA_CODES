26.The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique numeric book identifier
    which is printed on every book.
     The ISBN is based upon a 10-digit code.
 	The ISBN is legal if:
 	1 × digit1 + 2 × digit2 + 3 × digit3 + 4 × digit4 + 5 × digit5 + 6 × digit6 + 7 ×
 	digit7 + 8 × digit8 + 9 × digit9 + 10 × digit 10 is divisible by 11.
 	Example : For an ISBN 1401601499
 	Sum = 1×1 + 2×4 +3×0 + 4×1 + 5×6 + 6×0 + 7×1 + 8×4 + 9×9 + 10×9 =
 	253 which is divisible by 11.
 	Write a program to :
 	(i) Input the ISBN code as a 10-digit integer.
 	(ii) If the ISBN is not a 10-digit integer, output the message,
 	“Illegal ISBN” and terminate the program.
 	(iii) If the number is 10-digit, extract the digits of the number and
 	    compute the sum as explained above.
 	    If the sum is divisible by 11, output the message, “Legal ISBN”.
 	    If the sum is not divisible by 11, output the message, “Illegal ISBN”.

       Ex - 12321 - Rerverse - 12321

45- Accept a number and check if it is a armstrong number (Sum of cube of all digits
    will be equal to origional number)
       Ex - 407 = 64 + 0 + 343 = 407
              153 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

    each digit)
       Ex- 145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 145
