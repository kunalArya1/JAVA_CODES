        --  HOW TO APPORACH ANY PATTERN QUESTION 

            STEP-1:
                NO OF LINES =NO OF ROWS =NO OF TIMES OUTER LOOP WILL RUN
                (IN SIMPLE WORD WE CAN SAY THAT RUN THE OUTER LOOP EQUAL TO THE GIVEN LINES IN PATTERN PROBLEMS)

            STEP-2:
                IDENTIFY COLUMN FOR EVERY ROW NO
                ## HOW MANY TIMES COLUMN ARE THERE
                ## TYPES OF ELEMENT IN COLUMN

            STEP-3:
                WHAT DO YOU NEED TO PRINT

            NOTE:-
                TRY TO FIND THE FORMULA RELATING ROWS AND COLUMNS
